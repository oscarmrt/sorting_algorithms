This project is about sorting algorithms:
0-bubble_sort.c, 0-O - Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
1-insertion_sort_list.c, 1-O - Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
2-selection_sort.c, 2-O - Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
3-quick_sort.c, 3-O - Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
